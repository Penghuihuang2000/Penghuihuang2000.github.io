Welcome to my homepage!  

I am a **Ph.D. candidate in Biostatistics** at University of Pittsburgh, advised by Dr. Chris McKennan. My doctoral research has also led to collaborations with clinicians and biologists on interdisciplinary projects in Alzheimerâ€™s disease, asthma, and reproductive health. Prior to my Ph.D., I earned a **B.S. in Statistics** from the University of Science and Technology of China.

## Research

My research focuses on developing and applying statistical and machine learning methods to address biomedical challenges.  

**Methodology.** My work centers on statistical genomics and genetics, with an emphasis on cellular deconvolution, multi-omics integration, Bayesian modeling, and statistical computing.  

**Applications.** I collaborate with biomedical researchers to apply these methods to large-scale studies in neurodegenerative disease, respiratory disease, and reproductive health, enabling insights into disease mechanisms and potential biomarkers.
