Welcome to Penghui's homepage! 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Biostatistics at the School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of Dr. Chris McKennan. During my doctoral studies, I have also collaborated with clinicians and biologists on interdisciplinary projects in Alzheimerâ€™s disease, asthma, and reproductive health. Prior to my Ph.D., I received a Bachelor of Science in Statistics from the University of Science and Technology of China.

My research interest lies in developing and applying statistical and machine learning methods to solve real biomedical problems. Methodologically, my work focuses on multi-omics integration, Bayesian modeling, statistical computing, and cellular deconvolution. On the applied side, I have developed and published novel frameworks (HiDecon, BLEND, cf-TREBLE, EMixed) and contributed to open-source software, enabling new discoveries from cfDNA, RNA-seq, DNA methylation, and single-cell/spatial transcriptomics. I am passionate about combining statistical innovation, big data analytics, and interdisciplinary collaboration to advance precision medicine and human health.

Outside of work, I enjoy tennis, weightlifting, swimming, painting and music.
