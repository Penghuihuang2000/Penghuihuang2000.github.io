Hey! Welcome to Penghui's homepage! I am currectly a PhD student in biostatistics at the University of Pittsburgh [(Pitt biostat)](https://www.sph.pitt.edu/biostatistics). I received my B.S. in statistics from University of Science and Technology of China [(USTC stat)](https://en.business.ustc.edu.cn/audsf/list.htm) in 2022. My current research interest lies in statistical genomics and genetics. I love data-driven research. I believe many potential ideas or insights lie in data analysis results. All it takes is to keep being curious and critical.

Outside of work, I enjoy tennis, working out, swimming, painting and music.
