BLEND is a hierarchical Bayesian method that integrates multiple single-cell reference datasets to accurately deconvolve bulk omics data. By learning the best reference for each sample and modeling cell-type profiles within the convex hull of references, BLEND outperforms existing methods and provides new insights into disease progression.
